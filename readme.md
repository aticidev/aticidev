Hey there,

Welcome to my humble abode in the Digital World.

This is **Muhammet AtÄ±cÄ±** who lives in **Istanbul, Turkey**.

I'm a self-taught **software developer** who is passionate creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include PHP (dead), Go (long live) and Javascript (meh). I'm always questioning the status quo and wanting to improve. I willing to think outside the box.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my side projects.
- ðŸŒ± I'm trying to learn **rust** language.
- ðŸ˜„ I was an physicist & astronomer before becoming a software developer.
- ðŸ’µ Outside of software development, I spend my time with crypto trading.
